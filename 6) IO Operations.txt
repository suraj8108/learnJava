OutputStream class
OutputStream class is an abstract class. 
It is the superclass of all classes representing an output stream of bytes. 
An output stream accepts output bytes and sends them to some sink.

Methods:
1) write(int) throws IO Exception
2) write(byte[]) throws IO Exception
3) flush() throws IO Exception
4) close() throws IO Exception

InputStream class
InputStream class is an abstract class. It is the superclass of all classes representing an input stream of bytes.

Methods:
1) read()     throws IO Exception --> reads the next byte of data from the input stream. It returns -1 at the end of the file.
2) avaibale() throws IO Exception --> returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read from the current input stream.
3) close()    throws IOException  --> 	is used to close the current input stream.
