														Multi Threading in Java
													------------------------------


https://www.javatpoint.com/multithreading-in-java

	* Multi Threading	
		-> Multithreading involves creating multiple threads within a single process.
		-> Each thread runs concurrently, sharing the same memory space.
		-> Java Multithreading is mostly used in games, animation, etc.

	* Multi Processing
		-> Multiprocessing involves using multiple CPUs or processors to execute multiple processes simultaneously.
		-> Processes have separate memory spaces, which makes communication between processes more complex and slower.

	* Advantages of Multi Threading
		-> Does not blocks the user as threads are independent and can perform multiple operations.
		-> Saves time
		-> Threads are independent so exception in one thread wont halt the other thread.
	
	* Thread in Java
		-> A thread is a lightweight subprocess, the smallest unit of processing.
		-> Threads in same process shares the same CPU.
		NOTE: At a time one thread is executed only.
		
		Suppose we have a dual core CPU and two process to run which has three threads then at a time only two threads can execute on dual core. 
		
	* Context Switching
		->  The operating system’s scheduler allocates CPU time to each thread, switching between them to ensure they all get a chance to execute.

Thread Creation
---------------------

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-in-java/

Threads can be created by two ways:

		1. Extending the Thread class 
			-> Create a class that extends Thread Class. This class overrides the run() method available in thread class.
			-> To start the execution(run method) of thread create the class object and invoke .start() method on it.
			-> Example coded.
			
		2. Implementing the Runnable Interface
			-> Create a class (MyRunnable) that implements the Runnable Functional Interface and provides the implementation of run method.
			-> The instance of this class(MyRunnable) is passed in Thread to create it as thread.
					Thread th = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
					
			-> Advantage of this is that we can now extend any other class as well from (MyRunnable) class. Earlier approach has that restriction.
		
		IMP
			-> When program calls Thread.start() a new thread gets created and then the run method is executed.
			-> In case if directly run method is called then no new thread gets created and program runs as a normal method call.
			
			-> We can not call start method twice else it gived an exception
--------------------
Life cycle of thread
--------------------

		1. New State				-> Thread yet to start
		2. Runnable State			-> Thread for CPU to give plaform to run. 
		3. Blocked / Waiting State	-> Blocked Thread is trying to lock a resource which is already been locked by other thread.
		4. Timed Waiting State		-> Tread is slept for few seconds based on the time value passed.
		5. Terminated State			-> Thread can be terminated either after completing the job or some exeception/event had occurred.

------------------
Methods of Threads
------------------

	* start()				->	Begins the execution of the thread. The JVM calls the run() method of this thread. 
	* sleep(long millis)	-> Causes the currently executing thread to sleep (pause execution) for the specified number of milliseconds.
	* interrupt()			-> Interrupts a thread that is in the sleeping, waiting, or blocked state.
	* t1.join() 			-> Waits for the thread t1 to die. This method allows one thread to wait for the completion of another.
	* isAlive()				-> Tests if the thread is alive (i.e., it has been started and has not yet died).
	* getName() /			-> Gets or sets the name of the thread.
		setName(String name)
	* getPriority() /		-> Gets or sets the priority of the thread.
		setPriority(int priority)
	* getState()			-> Returns the state of the thread (e.g., NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, TERMINATED).
	* yield()				-> Causes the currently executing thread to temporarily pause and allow other threads to execute.
		

--------------------
Main Thread
--------------------
	
	* When Java Program starts up, one thread begins running immediately. This is usually called the main thread of our program.
	* Two important feature of Main thread:
		1. It is the thread from which other “child” threads will be spawned.
		2. Often, it must be the last thread to finish execution because it performs various shutdown actions
	* The default priority of Main thread is 5 and for all remaining user threads priority will be inherited from parent to child.

----------------------------	
Priority In thread Sheduling 
----------------------------
	-> If same priority then first come first serve basis
	-> We cant run thread twice
	-> Default priority of a thread is 5 (NORM_PRIORITY). The value of MIN_PRIORITY is 1 and the value of MAX_PRIORITY is 10.


----------------------------
Demon Thread
----------------------------
	-> It is a low priority thread that run in the background to perform tasks such as garbage collection or provide services to user threads.
	
	Note: If you want to make a user thread as Daemon, it must not be started otherwise it will throw IllegalThreadStateException.

	Garbage Collector
		-> The Garbage collector of JVM collects only those objects that are created by new keyword. So if you have created any object without new, 
			you can use finalize method to perform cleanup processing (destroying remaining objects).

		-> Garbage collection is performed by a daemon thread called Garbage Collector(GC). This thread calls the finalize() method before object 
			is garbage collected.

-------------------------
Synchronization
-------------------------
	-> It is the concept of ensuring multiple threads to interact with shared resource safely.
	
	* Synchronized Block
		-> When a thread invokes a synchronized method, it automatically acquires the lock for that object and releases it when the thread completes its task.
