													STRING IN JAVA
											--------------------------------
											
https://www.javatpoint.com/java-string

	-> String is basically an object that represents sequence of char values..
	-> The java.lang.String class implements Serializable, Comparable and CharSequence interfaces.

	-> CharSequence interface is implemented by String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer Class.Using this we can create the String using this classes only.

	-> Java String is immutable(We cant change its value) which makes it as thread safe. Whenever we change a new instance will be created.
	-> For mutable string we can use StringBuffer and StringBuilder

Two ways to create an String

	1) Using literal
		String s1="Welcome";  
		String s2="Welcome";//It doesn't create a new instance. Pointing to a same instance. 

		-> While creating a string JVM checks for string constant pool. If string exists then no need to create a new String just give the reference of that.
		-> It is preferred to use String literals as it allows JVM to optimize memory allocation.

	2) Using new keyword
		-> It adds one more layer of creating an object in heap memory
		-> We we create a String using new keyword, JVM handles it as 
			* Heap Memory: 				A new string object is created in the heap memory.
			* String Constant Pool: 	The literal “Welcome” is placed in the string constant pool if it is not already present.
			* Reference: 				The variable s will refer to the new string object in the heap memory, not the one in the string constant pool.
		-> Using new keyword object is always created in the heap memory, even if the literal already exists in the string constant pool.

String Class
	* String class is Final so that no one can override and change its implementation
	
	Constructor of String
		* String(); //Sets value ""
		* String(String value)
		* String(char[] value)
		* String(char[] value, int offset, int count)     			

	Compare Strings in Java
		1) equals() 	compares original contents
		2) ==	    	compares refrence not values
		3) compareTo()	compares value lexicographically

	Advantages of Immutable Strings
		* ClassLoader(String []args)
		* Thread Safe
		* Security
		* Heap Space


	Methods of String
	
		1) .charAt(index)							7) .replace(CharSequence old, CharSequence new)
		2) .length()								8) .equals(Object a);
		3) .substring(index) 						9) .equalsIgnoreCase(String another)	
		//index from where we want till last		10) .toLowerCase()				
		4) .substring(beginindex, endindex)			11) .toUpperCase()
		5) .contains(CharSequence s)				12) .indexOf(String substring)
		6) .concat(String s)       

	* Concatenation Methods
	
		1) Using symbol "+"

			IMP <<<<<<<---------------->>>>>>>>NOTE: After a string literal, all the + will be treated as string concatenation operator.
		
			Java Compiler Transforms this 
				
				String s="Sachin"+" Tendulkar";  
					To This
				String s=(new StringBuilder()).append("Sachin").append(" Tendulkar).toString();  

			Concatenation is implemeted through String Builder

		2) Using Method "concat()"
			//String s3 = s1.concat(s2)
			
			a)String concatenation using StringBuilder class
				.append(val)	val = Objects, StringBuilder, int, char, CharSequence, boolean, float, double	
		
			b) String concatenation using format() method
				String s = String.format("%s%s",s1,s2);   //String 3 to store the result  
		
			c) String concatenation using String.join() method (Java Version 8+)
				String.join() accepts argument first a separator and an array of String objects.
		
			d) String concatenation using Collectors.joining() method (Java (Java Version 8+)


	* Substring in Java
		Note: Index starts from 0.
			
			public String substring(int startIndex):
			
			public String substring(int startIndex, int endIndex):
			startIndex: inclusive
			endIndex: exclusive


	* Split in Java
		Using delimiter or a string 
		String[] sentences = text.split("\\.");

	* toUpperCase()
	* toLowerCase()
	* trim() //eliminates white spaces before and after the String.
	* startsWith(String), endsWith(String) returns boolean
	* .charAt()
	* length()
	* String.valueOf(1) -> converts int, long, float, double, boolean, char and char array into String.
	* .replace(old, new) -> updates all the occurences

									---------------------------------------
											Java StringBuffer Class
									---------------------------------------

	Sting Buffer is same as string class only difference is it is mutable

Constructor
	* StringBuffer() 		 		// It creates an empty String buffer with the initial capacity of 16.
	* StringBuffer(String str) 		// It creates a String buffer with the specified string..
	* StringBuffer(int capacity) 	// It creates an empty String buffer with the specified capacity as length.

Methods of StringBuffer
	1) .append(String)							// can append boolean, char, string, float, int, double, 
	2) .insert(offset, String)					// can insert boolean, char, string, float
	3) .replace(startIndex, endIndex, string)	// endIndex not Included
	4) .delete(startIndex, endIndex) 			// endIndex not Included
	5) .reverse()


									----------------------------------------
											Java StringBuilder Class
									----------------------------------------
Constructor same as StringBuffer class

Same all fnctions as StringBuffer


									----------------------------------------
											String VS StringBuffer
									----------------------------------------
	-> String is slow and consumes more memory when we concatenate too many strings
	-> String is immutable
	-> Uses String constant pool while String buffer uses Heap Memory


									----------------------------------------
										StringBuffer VS StringBuilder
									----------------------------------------
1)
StringBuffer is synchronized i.e. thread safe. It means two threads can't call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously.
StringBuilder is non-synchronized i.e. not thread safe. It means two threads can call the methods of StringBuilder simultaneously. 

2)
StringBuffer is less efficient than StringBuilder.
StringBuilder is faster and high in performance like append, delete, replace is faster compare to StringBuffer

3) 
StringBuffer was introduced in Java 1.0
StringBuilder was introduced in Java 1.5

									----------------------------------------
												String Tokenizer
									----------------------------------------
	-> java.util.StringTokenizer
	-> Similar to Split method
	-> Divides a string in to tokens and loops to each of them

	-> The StringTokenizer class is deprecated now. It is recommended to use the split() method of the String class or the Pattern class that 
		belongs to the java.util.regex package.

	StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer("my name is khan"," ");  

Methods
	a) boolean hasMoreTokens()
	b) String nextToken()
	c) boolean hasMoreElements() //same as hasMoreTokens()
	d) Object nextElement()	  //It is the same as nextToken() but its return type is Object.
	e) int countTokens()



									----------------------------------------
												Immutable Class
									----------------------------------------

	Java Immutable class 
		* String
		* Boolean
		* Byte 
		* Short
		* Integer
		* Long
		* Float
		* Double, etc 
		* Wrapper classes and String class
		
	-> We can make a class an Immutable by making class as final, no setter method and all variables as final

	-> The class is immutable because:
		a) The instance variable of the class is final i.e. we cannot change the value of it after creating an object.
		b) The class is final so we cannot create the subclass.
		c) There is no setter methods i.e. we have no option to change the value of the instance variable.

	-> toString() in Java
		Prints the Object. Compiler internally invokes the toString() method on the object. We can ovveride it.
		By default it prints HashCode of object but by overriding it we can print as we want.
